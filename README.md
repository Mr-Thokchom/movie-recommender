# Movie Recommender System

Recommendation systems are a collection of algorithms used to recommend items to users based on information taken from the user. These systems have become very popular, and can be commonly seen in online stores, movies databases and job finders. In this project we will create a movie recommender system which recommends the top 5 movies with respect to the user selected movie.
